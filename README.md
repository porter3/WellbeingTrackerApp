# **Well-being Tracker Functionality Explanation**

The application's purpose is to allow a user to choose certain health-related metrics to track on a regular basis
(i.e. total exercise time, hours of sleep, social time, meditation time, etc.) and display them 
on a line graph next to each other. These metrics can be quantitative (i.e. hours of sleep), or 
subjective (i.e. mood), the latter of which is rated on a scale (hardcoded at the moment). Users can 
create an account, add/remove metric types to track, and log metric entries for a given date.
